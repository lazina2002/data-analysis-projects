# Google Play Store EDA

This project explores the **Google Play Store dataset** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques. The aim is to analyze various attributes of apps available on the Play Store, including ratings, category distribution, size, reviews, and more.

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform the following tasks:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and key metrics.
- **Insights**: Understanding factors affecting app ratings, installs, and performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Google Play Store dataset**, which contains information about apps, their categories, ratings, reviews, sizes, installs, and more.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** (for data analysis)
- **Google Colab** (for interactive analysis)
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` (for data manipulation)
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (for visualizations)
  - `NumPy` (for numerical operations)

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by removing duplicates and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualize distributions of numeric variables (e.g., ratings, reviews).
   - Explore relationships between different attributes (e.g., rating vs. size, installs).
   - Investigate the most common app categories and their trends.
3. **Insights**:
   - The correlation between app size and rating.
   - Popular categories and their user ratings.
   - The impact of the number of installs on the ratings.
